There will definitely be spoilers in here. 

Here‚Äôs *one* of my favorite ones. It‚Äôs a little long but just so good.

*From Haikyuu, chapter 361, by Shiratorizawa coach Tanji Washij≈ç*



For the longest time, I was convinced that if you didn‚Äôt have enough height yourself, you didn‚Äôt have a choice but to find ways without height. 

Right now, the amount of power Karasuno‚Äôs number 10 has is minuscule. Yet, this whole time he has been fighting to win with height.

‚ÄúWithout that Kageyama at setter, I don‚Äôt see any value in you at all.‚Äù He knows. I didn‚Äôt have to tell him that. Karasuno‚Äôs 10 knows.

I will admit that I was jealous of tall folk. After all, ain‚Äôt being tall great? They get to be big and strong. They can reach heights no one else can, looking down at the rest of the world.


‚ÄúForty years. That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve coached this sport. And I‚Äôll put it all on the line to deny you and everything you are, Karasuno number 10...‚Äù

But right now, those four long decades seem faint, fading away under the shout from the ten oh-so-brief years that preceded them.

No greater righteousness than height. No greater majesty than size. Looking down across all the world below you...

That is the best volleyball.

**Those years are screaming at me, saying that I can play that way too**",1624325261.0
11,HQ fanons/headcanons I want more of,2,o5043e,haikyuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/haikyuu/comments/o5043e/hq_fanonsheadcanons_i_want_more_of/,0,"We have enough HQ characters x reader content, here are some things I think need more attention. 

1. Hinata Natsu interactions
- IMAGINE THE SOFTNESS
- Karasuno training Natsu to be a volleyball prodigy. She‚Äôs basically a meta-player that learned every player‚Äôs specialty move. (Oml Natsu rolling thunder)
- everyone melting when Natsu smiles. Third years are crying, yams passes out, tsukki and Kags freezing up and not understanding what this fuzzy feeling is. Second years are screaming as usual.
- We thought Shoyo was sunshine personified but Natsu is on a whole other level. 
- time skip volleyball player Natsu reminiscing about the times when her big brothers taught her the tips and tricks she uses on the court during an interview and explaining why she chose the number 10.
- Natsu riding on Daichi‚Äôs shoulders
- Natsu riding on TSUKKIs shoulders
- Natsu braiding Asahi‚Äôs hair
- Suga holding her and carrying her everywhere, refusing to put her down because he‚Äôs afraid she‚Äôll run around and hurt herself or get lost (because we know she has the energy of a Hinata) protective sugamama. ALSO Suga realizing his dream of being a school teacher because of how much he loves taking care of Natsu
- Teen Natsu growing up to be really outgoing and strong headed like her brother, but that also means she is no longer a small bean but CAN and WILL pummel the entirety of Karasuno if they get too loud. 
- KARASUNO INTIMIDATING NATSU‚ÄôS BOYFRIEND (or guys who try to hit on her). Clearly, like teen Natsu but the point is overprotective Karasuno not letting any male near her and Natsu being fed up with their bs. Like Tanaka and Noya literally about to obliterate any guy who is within a 6ft radius. ‚ÄúNope, don‚Äôt even look at her‚Äù
- Kiyoko and Yachi being major doting big sisters. GIRLS ONLY CORNER OF THE GYM. If Karasuno are protecting her from other boys, managers protecting her from the Karasuno boys. 
- other teams being confused when there is a Hinata Shoyo 2.0 like oikawa trying to set her up with his nephew but Iwa‚Äôs like STOP SHES FOUR. 
- Shoyo stops growing at like 16 and Natsu catches up and they get mistaken for twins ALL THE TIME.
- Shoyo forcing all of MSBY to watch Natu‚Äôs games 
- Karasuno going to Natsu‚Äôs games together and cheering for her. They be so fricken loud and chaotic she‚Äôs like thanks but pls stop your embarrassing. Then after the game they force her to have a little after game meeting and discuss her strategies and skills. Literally they will not give up trying to live vicariously through her. All Natsu‚Äôs teammates thinking it‚Äôs so cool that she knows all these pro VB players but Natsu‚Äôs just like no their all idiots and annoying. 
- COACH UKAI GIVING HER FREE SNACKS FROM THE STORE. 
- Natsu has somehow attached herself to Takeda-sensei and sensei 100% okay with that and reads her poetry or smthn.

2. Yachi ships other than Kiyoko
- nothing against Yachi x Kiyoko content but I think our girl needs some spice in her life.

- YACHI X KUROO 
- holy cow the height difference
- I feel like their relationship could go two ways: Yachi being a nervous wreck all the time cause she can‚Äôt handle just how much she likes him and kuroo teasing her about it but is super gentle because he wants her to feel comfortable with him OR Yachi being really laid-back (only with kuroo) and keeps saying how cute Kuroo is but Kuroo being a whiny bf about how she‚Äôs the cute one and him trying to look cool in front of her but failing and Yachi just laughing about it.
- Yachi not knowing how to handle how CLINGY kuroo is, he‚Äôs like a big dog who thinks he‚Äôs a small dog. 
- PERFECT spooning. Kuroo likes how she fits perfectly in his arms and how tiny and frail she is.
- Kuroo is a SIMP for Yachi, follows her everywhere, buys her small plushies, brings her lunch
- long distance relationship struggles. FT always ends up with Yachi falling asleep and kuroo taking a thousand screenshots before finally hanging up. Kuroo waiting anxiously at the bus stop for Yachi and the second she steps off the bus he picks her up and refuses to let go for the entire day. 
- Kuroo trying to act cool in front of her but ends up revealing his dorkiness but Yachi thinking it‚Äôs adorable. 
- big scary dog privileges.
- Yachi giggling to herself when she hears other girls talking about how cool Kuroo is. Like ‚Äúlol he‚Äôs actually an idiot but ok‚Äù 
- Yachi doesn‚Äôt get jealous but if she does by rare chance she‚Äôs pretty passive about it but a little pouty and kuroo thinks it‚Äôs adorable. But also Yachi not getting jealous and kuroo being upset that she‚Äôs not. 
- Kuroo gets SUPER jealous, when he‚Äôs angry he gets super intimidating and his voice gets really low (Yachi thinks it‚Äôs kinda hot). Yachi is oblivious to boys flirting with her that Kuroo just swoops in out of nowhere and scares them away before Yachi realizes what‚Äôs happening. 

- YACHI X DAICHI
-probably my favorite Yachi ship. Charismatic and strict Captain Daichi has a soft spot for Yachi. 
- the team saying how unfair it is how nice he is to Yachi but scary towards them but Daichi has no idea what their talking about. He‚Äôs in denial.
- Daichi is the SWEETEST bf and Yachi the SWEETEST gf their relationship is all fluff (on the outside atleast (; )
- Daichi walking yachi home every night after practice making sure that she gets in safe and doesn‚Äôt leave until he sees the lights turn on in her house since her mom is always home late. Yachi always waves out the window to tell him she‚Äôs okay.
- Yachi agonizing over every text she sends him 
- Kiyoko being Daichi‚Äôs wingman
- Yachi sneaking glances and Daichi‚Äôs muscles during practice (especially his thicc thighs) and Daichi noticing and flexing for her and Yachi blushing so hard.
- Yachi loves his hugs because his arms are so big like a bear
- Yachi kissing him on the cheek as a good luck before a match and runs away out of embarrassment and leaves a spaced out daichi. 
- Sometimes Yachi‚Äôs anxiety gets out of control or she self-deprecates but Daichi is like her rock to always calm her down and tell her how strong a beautiful she is. 
- Yachi only has eyes for Daichi during practice but the first years (mostly Hinata but kags is terrible at hiding it) are whiny for her attention too.

- Other smaller Yachi ships

- Yachi x Tsukki: study dates, also height difference, tsukki affectionately watching Yachi being a chaotic babie. 
- Yachi x Ushijima: I know this is weird but think about how cute this would be. Tiny chaotic nervous wreck Yachi and big head-empty ushijima literally picking her up like a child to calm her down. 
- Yachi x Akaashi: Akaashi is literally ALWAYS watching and observing all of Yachi‚Äôs little ticks and habits and is always ready to swoop in when she needs something. His face is a little hard to read and he doesn‚Äôt say much but he loves to see Yachi smile so he‚Äôs always trying to do something for her and Yachi always brightens up when she sees him. 

And lastly,
More Daichi thirst trap. Thank you.",1624324271.0

13,Name post #15: Hinata Shouyou and Natsu,23,o4j62w,haikyuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/haikyuu/comments/o4j62w/name_post_15_hinata_shouyou_and_natsu/,2,"In celebration of Hinata's birthday (and the start of my favorite season), I thought I'd take a look at his name. I'll add Natsu's analysis as well because it's summer solstice and it's appropriate.

----

**Family name:** Hinata Êó•Âêë /'hinata/

Êó• (/hi/) - ""day"", ""sun"", ""Japan""; read with its kun-yomi (native Japanese reading), it means ""day"" or ""sun"" (Êó• /hi/); with one of its on-yomi readings, it is found in the word ""Japan"" (Êó•Êú¨ /nihon/ or /nippon/, literally ""the origin of sun""); Êó• is fairly often found in family names

Âêë (/nata/) - ""to face"", ""to approach""; usually found in the verb ""to face"", ""to go towards"" (Âêë„Åã„ÅÜ /mukau/); the kanji also means ""having the propensity for something"" in many cases; the reading /nata/ is a special reading used in names, [nanori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanori)

The two kanji combine to create a common word, Êó•Âêë (/hinata/), which translates as ""sunny place"" or ""in the sun"". The choice of this family name for Hinata's character might also allude to his tendency to be bright, cheerful and open.

Translation: ""sunny place""

Hinata exists as both a family name and a unisex given name, with the given name using the same kanji combination as in Hinata's family name, as well as many others. It is a rather common family name, with over 3200 households using that kanji combination ([source](http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/%7Esuzakihp/index40.html)).

**Given name:** Shouyou ÁøîÈôΩ /'shouyou/

Áøî (/shou/) - ""to fly"", ""to soar""; the kanji is generally used in people's names or as an alternative to the more common kanji for flight, È£õ (found in both Kageyama's given name and on Karasuno's banner)

ÈôΩ (/you/) - ""sunshine"", ""positive"", ""male""; with its kun-yomi /hi/, it is an alternative kanji to Êó• from Hinata's family name; with the on-yomi (adapted Chinese reading), it's found in many common words, notably ""Sun"" (Â§™ÈôΩ /taiyou/), ""cheerful""/""lively"" (ÈôΩÊ∞ó /youki/) and ""positivity"" (ÈôΩÊÄß /yousei/) and some less common, for example ""diversion"" (ÈôΩÂãï /youdou/, a possible reference to Hinata's decoy plays); it also signifies ""yang"" in yin and yang and therefore has the connotation of masculinity

Translation: ""flying sun/positivity""

Transliteration note: can also be transliterated as Sh≈çy≈ç. More on various Japanese transliteration methods [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese).

Imagery of the name ([source](https://namehintbox.com/namedata.php?n=%E7%BF%94%E9%99%BD)):

For Áøî: Ëá™Áî±„Å´„ÅÆ„Å≥„ÅÆ„Å≥„Å®„ÄÇÂ§¢„Å´Âêë„Åã„Å£„Å¶ÁæΩ„Å∞„Åü„ÅÑ„Å¶„Åª„Åó„ÅÑ„ÄÇ(Jiyuu ni nobinobi to. Yume ni mukatte habataite hoshii.)  
To be free and without worries. Wishing to spread one's wings towards their dreams.

For ÈôΩ: Â§™ÈôΩ„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´Âë®Âõ≤„ÇíÂÖÉÊ∞ó„Å´„Åï„Åõ„Çã‰∫∫„Å´„ÄÇ(Taiyou no you ni shuui wo genki ni saseru hito ni.)  
To be a person who shines brightly upon their surroundings.

I think this is an extremely accurate characterization of Hinata as someone who keeps striving towards his goal and is a positive influence on people around him, inspiring many to give their best and encouraging their growth like the sun does for many things in nature.

Shouyou is an exclusively male name. Based on the stroke order fortune telling, it is an extremely lucky name. Combined with his family name, it is exceptionally lucky in aspects such as character and interpersonal relationships, and unlucky in more esoteric aspects (luck based on the five Chinese elements and yin and yang) ([source](https://namehintbox.com/handanresult.php?name=%E6%97%A5%E5%90%91_%E7%BF%94%E9%99%BD)). I think that is still pretty appropriate as he was not blessed with the physique that would be beneficial to his dream and therefore faces many obstacles in that regard, but is also extremely positive and sociable.

Hinata shares all kanji except Êó• with at least one other character (and he obviously shares Êó• with his sister).

-----

**Given name:** Natsu Â§è /'natsu/

Â§è (/natsu/) - ""summer""; used in various words relating to the summer season, among others, in the word for ""summer solstice"" (Â§èËá≥ /geshi/), which is also her brother's birthday; the reading /natsu/ is the common reading for the word ""summer""

Translation: ""summer""

Imagery of the kanji ([source](https://namehintbox.com/namedata.php?n=%E5%A4%8F)):

Êòé„Çã„ÅèÊ¥ªÁô∫„Å™Â≠ê„Å´„ÄÇ(Akaruku kappatsuna ko ni.)  
To be a bright and lively child.

This seems to be an accurate description of Natsu as we have seen her in the story.

Natsu is a unisex name, which makes Hinata Natsu's entire name unisex. On its own, it's pretty unlucky based on the stroke order and stays that way in combination with Hinata as a family name ([source](https://namehintbox.com/handanresult.php?name=%E6%97%A5%E5%90%91_%E5%A4%8F)).

**Bonus stuff:** another common reading of the Êó•Âêë kanji combination is /hyuuga/. There is a citrus fruit called [hyuganatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyuganatsu), which basically makes Natsu an orange, which in turn corresponds to her and her brother's color scheme.

------

**Bonus stuff 2:** totally random and unrelated, but as mentioned, /hinata/ and /hyuuga/ are two readings of the same kanji combination, which means that Hyuuga Hinata from Naruto is basically named the same thing twice. Since Naruto doesn't use kanji for given names, it's impossible to say whether her name would really be written as Êó•Âêë Êó•Âêë, but it's a fun idea. Other members of the Hyuuga family generally also have given names related to the sun or turning/spinning. There is also a minor Hyuuga clan member, Hyuuga Natsu, who shares her name with Hinata Natsu and consequently the citrus fruit as well.

-----

I had originally planned to add the ways Hinata and Kageyama's names combine in this post, but realized halfway through that the post is way too long as is. I hope it was an interesting read to anyone who actually gets to the end.

I'd like to do name combinations as a separate post, but I'd like to do Kageyama's name post before that. I don't know when that might be, but hopefully before Kageyama's birthday.

how do people find Season 4 atsumu likable?

tbh this is a genuine question like I want to know what people like about season 4 atsumu because i really don't understand it. 
my main problem started with him when he called kageyama a goody two shoes. still to this day I don't understand why atsumu provoked kageyama by calling him a goody two shoes and why did it even bother kageyama so much. from what ive fathomed,it seemed like atsumu saw kageyama communicating w his teammates well and that's why he called kageyama a goody two shoes..

 BUT in a team sport communication is key and kageyama knows that, he learnt it by being in the karasuno team. then why did he feel all these various emotions after receiving that comment.. did he think that being a goody two shoes wasn't enough?? see, the timeline and kageyamas mental state confuses me. kageyama was in good form during the shiratorizawa match. he was alright/ didn't seem to have internal complexes. then he goes to the youth camp and it was going fine. and then atsumu assessed him with the term ""goody two shoes"". after that kageyama comes back to karasuno.


AND THEN KAGEYAMA HAS A BREAKDOWN DURING THE DATEKO PRACTICE MATCH. starts misbehaving with  the seniors, basically he got into his true king of court form. now i just want to understand what provoked this. was it atsumu's comment? did he feel like atsumu was mocking him?",1623992360.0

85,Kageyama Kuestion,14,o22n8f,haikyuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/haikyuu/comments/o22n8f/kageyama_kuestion/,10,"Ok forgive me for the terrible alliteration, but I couldn‚Äôt resist. 

I wanted to make a discussion post surrounding Kageyama‚Äôs characterization and development during the show. I only just started reading the manga (just finished  Vol. 1) so I have to spoiler tag this post but PLEASE DON‚ÄôT SPOIL ME BEYOND THE ANIME. 

While reading the first volume of the manga, during the 3-on-3 with the first years Kageyama very explicitly says that his biggest fear is that he will set and there will be no one there to hit. Hinata then replies with the typical ‚Äúwell I have never gotten a set before so don‚Äôt worry, I will always be there no matter where you set it.‚Äù Which is just the best thing ever. 

While reading that it made me think about how, in the anime, Kageyama never really got a lot of substantive development beyond the advice he got from Oikawa to give the sets the hitters like best. We never really see him struggle with that fear for more than a few scenes. While the show does touch on Kags‚Äô conflict with this idea, it never seems to manifest much in a change in outlook or actions. At the end of the anime he is still the same person for the most part, he just has more trust in his teammates. Now contrast this with Hinata who has been humbled several times through the show and has had to change his outlook, bits of his personality, and truly change as a person. Also through flashbacks we get to see several other characters and their journey to get to where they are. They struggle and evolve over time and still change themselves during the matches. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is that, in the anime, it feels like Kageyama never got that much focus on his emotions and character beyond literal volleyball skills. Characters like Atsumu and Oikawa get to show their personality and journey in a way that we just haven‚Äôt seen with Kags. Now this may be explored further in the manga, but so far I really feel like Kags is just a setter and we don‚Äôt get to be inside his head enough to fully see in what ways he has grown beyond new volleyball skills. 

What do you all think? 

Again please do not put manga spoilers here.",1623979624.0
